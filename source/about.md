**😊 Hi, I'm Kiki.**

I love **coding** and **climbing**. I started learning both since 2019 and although I'm not great at either yet, the journey has been incredibly fun and rewarding so far. I was a marketing manager before the dev life, after leading a couple of digital marketing projects, I got interested in how apps are developed. From there, I started to learn web development by myself.

In 2021, I released **[my first application](https://kikiren.github.io/2022/04/07/cika-exchange/)** and people love it! I was really motivated from it, and since then I was onboarded to so many **[amazing projects](https://kikiren.github.io/)** and worked with excellent and experienced developers.

In 2022, I moved to 🇺🇸, I'm looking forward to continue my jounery of being a happy coder here!
